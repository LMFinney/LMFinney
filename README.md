After more than a decade focused on the Java desktop world, I've been in the Angular/JavaScript/TypeScript space since 2014.

Since 2017, I've been a developer at [Oasis Digital](https://github.com/oasisdigital) and an instructor with [Angular Boot Camp](https://github.com/angularbootcamp). You may have seen me speak occationally at Angular conferences or Meetups.

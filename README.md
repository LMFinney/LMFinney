### ngLanceFinney

After more than a decade focused on the Java desktop world, I've been in the Angular/JavaScript/TypeScript space since 2014.

I used to be a developer at [Oasis Digital](https://github.com/oasisdigital) and an instructor with [Angular Boot Camp](https://github.com/angularbootcamp), but now I develop for Cisco. You may have seen me speak occasionally at Angular conferences or Meetups.

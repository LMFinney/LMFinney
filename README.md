### ngLanceFinney

After more than a decade focused on the Java desktop world, I've been in the Angular/JavaScript/TypeScript space since 2014.

I develop on Angular projects with Inficon, and I used to be an instructor with [Angular Boot Camp](https://github.com/angularbootcamp). You may have seen me speak occasionally at Angular conferences or Meetups.
